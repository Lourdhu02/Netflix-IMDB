   - Displays the highest-rated and most-voted movies with their IMDB scores, release year, and total votes.
   - Key metrics are shown using card visuals and line charts for a quick overview.

2. **Top 10 Movies by IMDB Score & Votes:**
   - An interactive slicer allows users to toggle between:
     - Top 10 IMDB-rated movies.
     - Top 10 most voted movies.
   - Bar charts visualize these top 10 movies for easy comparison.

3. **IMDB Score and Votes Trend (Line Graph):**
   - A timeline split by release decade, showing the trend of average IMDB scores and votes over time.
   - Two lines represent the average IMDB rating and the total votes, making it easy to track how these factors have evolved.
